## Summary
Analysing runs with Power BI, just for fun.

## Plan
1. From strava get latest runs with API call to their service.
   -Simple
3. Add the data to to excel as a row
     - What data is relevant? how to optimise this
4. Use power Bi to create statistic and graphs
   - Use for fun, try to learn alot


## Final
Learned about power BI and strava API. Learned some data analysis and something new about me as a runner.
Maybe with these insights I can finally run maraton under 3:30 h
